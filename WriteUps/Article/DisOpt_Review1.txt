Reviewer #1: This paper is concerned with finding robust feasible
solutions to a system of quadratic equations, which has applications
in several areas including the power systems.

In my opinion, the paper is not well-written.
* Many abbreviations are used before defined (LP, SDP, etc.)
* There are several sentences needed to be rewritten. 
* The manuscript requires significant amount of editing.

The technical part of the paper is very unclear. This is the reason I
was unable to understand some parts of the paper and verify the
correctness of the theoretical results. Here are some concrete
examples from Section 3.1:

* F is assumed to be a real-valued function. But then H (a vector
  valued function) is used in place of F in Eq. (5).
* The Jacobian of a general function is a matrix in general. Hence,
  sign(J_F(x)) is not well-defined.
* Many notations are used without proper notation (interior, closure,
  boundary etc.).

Here are some concrete examples from Section 3.2:
* Assuming that "there is a unique solution to the forecasted system
  at which point the Jacobian is non-zero" might be too restrictive in
  the application problem since there are infinitely many solutions in
  power flow problem by simply shifting the phase angles.
* It is unclear whether the line \ell_{u^*} is well-defined or not.
* It was not clear to me at all the connection between topological
  degree theory and robust feasibility.
* Theorem 3.3: As before, in the power systems application, it might
  be restrictive to assume F is injective.

Here are some concrete examples from Section 4:

* The relation between the robustness margin of r and the several
  optimization problems in this section is not clear.
* Problem (10): The condition X=xx^T is equivalent to rank(Y)=1 and Y
  \succeq 0, where Y=[X x \\ x^T 1]. Although rank(Y)=1is nonconvex,
  constraint Y \succeq 0 is convex. It is not clear why the authors
  did not prefer to solve an SDP to get better bounds.
* The two sentences are Eq. (12) are contradictory.

Although solving robust version of PF or OPF is quite relevant from an
application point of view, I am not entirely convinced that the
problem studied in this paper has the same practical
relevance. Knowing the robustness margin does not necessarily
translate to solving the robust version of OPF efficiently or
accurately. Especially since even approximating the robustness margin
is quite expensive, I am not sure how that information can be used in
practice.

Finally, the computational results are not very satisfactory.

* Due to the comments I have about the assumptions mentioned before, I
  am a bit concerned about the applicability of the theory developed.
* I would like to repeat that it is quite expensive to obtain lower
  and upper bounds as reported in Table 1.
* It is not clear whether the results reported in Fig. 4 are "good" or
  "bad". It seems that the difference between lower and upper bounds
  get larger with the instance size.
* It seems that LP and LP-bounding have similar performance, which
  dominates IP approach. This seems quite counter-intuitive since the
  authors mention that LP and IP should have the same success.
